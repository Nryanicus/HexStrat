BUGS:
=============
HexCursor sometime has inaccurate position relative to game logic (cursor over outer hex in cap-menu recruitment)

attacks can still be launched from occupied areas. Related to above hexcursor bug?

if turn ended too soon after movement, greyOut continues and overrides standUp

TODO:
=============
Juice: have enemy unit move back a single pixel when you mouse over next to them

Have non-contextual commands, e.g. end turn while recruit menu is open, cancel current context and end before performing their usual command

game over screen

main menu, options

NOTES:
=============
