BUGS:
=============

HexCursor still lagging

Can double tap enter and have the AI turns fail is_current_player assertions

?? AI units moving through out of bounds hexes ??
units can move through non-hex spaces sometimes?

Capitol not cleaned up correctly

AI units 
MasterScene.mjs:157 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'moveTo' of undefined
after killing

TODO:
=============

Multithread AI so it doesn't stop animations

Optimise AI some

Juice
    have enemy unit move back a single pixel when you mouse over next to them

    have selected unit move a bit towards the moused over destination

UI
    Show enemy move/attack ranges when clicking on them

    Main menu
        - Seed for PRNG world gen
    Game menu
        - graphs?!?
        - gen new world
    game over screen
    
    Your/AI Turn Transistion Plaque
    
    AI thinking spinner

AI
    1. Kill capitols
    2. Kill units
    3. Take Territory
    4. Immobalise units
    5. build balanced army
        5.1 build counters
    6. spend all money
        6.1. move units around cap away

    disable input while AI takes turn

    sort AI moves so all recruits happen at the end and only the last is delayed

Testing
    debug option where UI/anim classes contruct a game state and compare it to the actual GameState

    stress test fast input to make sure tweens never put the game in an invalid representation

Game Balance
    Unit costs need to be increased. Doubled? Double digit costs will require different UI...
