BUGS:
=============

HexCursor still lagging

TODO:
=============
Juice: have enemy unit move back a single pixel when you mouse over next to them

disable input while AI takes turn

sort AI moves so all recruits happen at the end and only the last is delayed

debug option where UI/anim classes contruct a game state and compare it to the actual GameState

stress test fast input to make sure tweens never put the game in an invalid representation
