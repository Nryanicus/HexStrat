BUGS:
=============

HexCursor still lagging

units not properly registered after combat

TODO:
=============
Juice: have enemy unit move back a single pixel when you mouse over next to them

Have non-contextual commands cancel current context and end before performing their usual command
    - end turn while recruit menu is open

disable input while AI takes turn

sort AI moves so all recruits happen at the end and only the last is delayed

debug option where UI/anim classes contruct a game state and compare it to the actual GameState

--------------------

Main menu
    - Seed for PRNG world gen
