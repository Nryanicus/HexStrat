BUGS:
=============

HexCursor still lagging

Can double tap enter and have the AI turns fail is_current_player assertions

?? AI units moving through out of bounds hexes ??

dead capitols not cleaned up properly

TODO:
=============
Juice: have enemy unit move back a single pixel when you mouse over next to them

AI
    1. Kill capitols
    2. Kill units
    3. Take Territory
    4. Immobalise units
    5. build balanced army
        5.1 build counters
    6. spend all money
        6.1. move units around cap away

    disable input while AI takes turn

    sort AI moves so all recruits happen at the end and only the last is delayed

debug option where UI/anim classes contruct a game state and compare it to the actual GameState

stress test fast input to make sure tweens never put the game in an invalid representation
