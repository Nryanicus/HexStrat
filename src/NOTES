BUGS:
=============
HexCursor sometime has inaccurate position relative to game logic (cursor over outer hex in cap-menu recruitment)

attacks can still be launched from occupied areas. Related to above hexcursor bug?

if turn ended too soon after movement, greyOut continues and overrides standUp

unit cancelled before recruited not cleaned up properly, tweens get called

TODO:
=============
Juice: have enemy unit move back a single pixel when you mouse over next to them

Have non-contextual commands, e.g. end turn while recruit menu is open, cancel current context and end before performing their usual command

disable input while AI takes turn

multiple human players

game over screen

main menu, options
